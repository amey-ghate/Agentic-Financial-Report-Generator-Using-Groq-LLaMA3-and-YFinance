=====================================

This project is an **Agentic Financial Report Generator**, designed to create professional, markdown-formatted fundamental and valuation reports for publicly listed companies using AI. Powered by **Groq's LLaMA3 model**, the agent combines real-time financial data and reasoning capabilities to deliver insightful, structured outputs.

Features
--------

*   **Agentic Execution**: Uses the agno.agent framework to create a self-contained intelligent agent.
    
*   **Groq LLaMA3 Model**: Leverages the high-speed performance of Groqâ€™s LLaMA 3 (70B) model.
    
*   **YFinance Integration**: Fetches real-time data such as:
    
    1.  Stock price and changes
        
    2.  Analyst recommendations
        
    3.  Company fundamentals
        
    4.  Recent financial news
        
*   **Reasoning Tools**: Adds logical breakdown and intermediate steps behind the analysis.
    
*   **Structured Output**: Generates markdown tables with only the report content.
    
*   **Streamed Reasoning**: Intermediate thoughts and processing are streamed for transparency.
